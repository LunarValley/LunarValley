        <p>The role system in this server is based off of a wolf pack. The top three ranks will be chosen by the Alpha's. From Delta and below will be chosen by everyone else. Each rank will have different privileges (which are to be decided). 

(The difference between a role and a rank is the roles don't get any special privileges [Epsilon, Iota and Omega] but the ranks do [Zeta and up])

Alpha's - being the leaders of the pack. There are two Alphas, one male and one female. (Head-Admin)
Beta's - being right below the Alpha's and they're right hand man/woman. There is also one male and one female Beta. (Admin)
Selsa's - are just lesser Beta's. There is one male and one female as well. (Mod)

Delta's - are the most dominate of the under ranking members of the pack.
Gamma's - are the Beta's to the Delta's.
Zeta's - Zeta is the first rank ever assumed by a member.

Epsilon's - Ones that have been apart of the pack for a while but have yet to assume a rank.
Iota's -  The newcomers or the disrespectful members that are not quite Omega's.
Omega's - The lowest rank. The disrespectful or trouble makers. They are shown little mercy, but are able to prove themselves and leave this rank unless they did something terrible.</p>
